This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) backend application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (Mongoose).  

It provides RESTful APIs to manage enquiry data, including creating new records, viewing all enquiries, updating existing records, and deleting records.  

The project follows a clean MVC-style folder structure with separate controllers, routes, models, middleware, and database configuration.  

It is designed for learning and practicing backend development concepts such as API creation, middleware usage, environment variables, and database operations.
